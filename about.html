<h2><p style="color:blue"> What Causes Deforestation? </h2></p>
<p><h1 style="font-size:150%;"> Anywhere that has a high concentration of trees on the ground, deforestation can happen intentionally, naturally, or accidently. Deforestation causes include the following:</p>
<p>- Volcanic Eruptions</p>
<p>- Typhoons </p>
<p>- Temperature & Climate Change </p>
<p>- Drought </p>
<p>- Logging </p>
<p>- Mining </p>
<p>- Land Development </p>

<h2><p style="color:blue"> What Can Deforestation lead to? </h2></p>	
<p> These occurrences are risky because deforestation is a self-sustaining process that encourages more destruction.</p>
<p> Flooding, soil erosion, higher temperatures, and desertification can all happen more quickly and dramatically as a result of the loss of trees and underbrush.</p>
<p>The following are the effects and results brought on by ongoing deforestation:</p>
<p> Atmospheric </p>
<p>  Forests are carbon sinks that sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in its place.</p>
<p> By releasing the carbon dioxide they have stored back into the environment after being cut down, trees emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
<p> Water Effects </p>
<p> The amount of water in the atmosphere is regulated in part by trees. As trees are removed, less water is available for the soil to absorb.</p>
<p> Animal Habitats </p>
<p> Forest trees provide shelter, while the canopy helps regulate light and temperatures.</p>
<p> As these trees are removed, temperature variations, increased sunlight, and vulnerability could prove fatal for all forest plant and animal species.</p>
<p> Deforestation causes drier soil, which eventually won't sustain farming or cattle ranching.</p>

<h2><p style="color:blue"> How can we prevent this? </h2></p>
<p> There are several angles from which to view potential countermeasures to deforestation. Stopping the human actions that are creating it is the obvious solution.</p>
<p> However, as the population grows, so does the demand for the goods produced on previously forested area.</p>
<p> Plant a Tree- Every tree planted and cared for abates the effects of deforestation.</p> <imgsrc="tree.jpg">
